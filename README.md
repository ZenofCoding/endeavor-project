## Built With

* Sublime Text is pretty cool too I guess
* Balsamiq - Wireframe of choice 
* RoboMongo - Because .pretty() everything is tedious

## Walk throughs of code
For Project presentation, you can include snippets of code you found buggy, interesting, or are overall proud of here.  Try to limit the quantity and size to quick readable bits.

You can also show where you've used technologies you've learned and applied here.

```
function awesomeThing() {
    //...
    // try not to make it too long otherwise, point to filepaths:line numbers
    //...
}
```
